# About me

My name is Guillermo Fidalgo and I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Experimental High Energy Physics (CMS Experiment) at University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez [(UPRM)](https://www.uprm.edu/portada/) under the mentorship of professor [Sudhir Malik](http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/). I speak fluent english and spanish. I have a major in Physics and a Minor in applied mathematics. I like watching Netflix, playing Basketball, video games and billiards. 

I'm a lifelong learner and I'm also passionate about software training, education and outreach. I am in the training team of [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/ssc.html), [HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/training.html), and a certified instructor of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). 
I have done several outreach activities with high school teachers and students in Puerto Rico. 
I've organized and mentored many workshops teaching at different academic levels from high school students to new HEP Postdocs on how to use basic software tools and do analysis. 
In 2019 I founded the [Scientific Software Club](https://sites.google.com/upr.edu/ssc-uprm/home?authuser=0) (SSC) at my university. This was formed at UPRM to bring together students interested in software related research projects. We have given around 5 workshops including topics : Bash, Git and Python. 
Most recently, I've mentored interns in the [U.S. CMS PURSUE](https://sites.google.com/upr.edu/uscms-pursue/) program to increase participation from underrepresented groups in HEP.  
Additionally I've also a facilitated the 2023 and 2024 CMS Data Analysis School at the LHC Physics Center at Fermilab (CMSDAS@LPC).

My current interest is Machine Learning (ML) and its applications. I am using ML to monitor the data quality of CMS Tracker and its future upgrade. 
Recently, I've participated and won a Machine Learning Hackathon organized by Lockheed Martin using Transfer Learning to make use of a previously [trained CNN](https://github.com/GuillermoFidalgo/ItDepends/tree/final) with the task to classify surface images from Mars Curiosity rover. 
I'm also working on an analysis looking for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) studying the performance of the "High Level Trigger" used to identify events that may contain signature of decays of dark matter particles to what are known as "Emerging Jets". This work is soon to be published.
I have also authored the Snowmass2021 Community Engagement Frontier (CEF) contributed papers.

# Research Activities

1.  **Emerging Jets Analysis (Master Thesis, work in progress)**  
    Emerging Jets is the signature of the decay of dark matter particles. According to P. Schwaller
    
    > EMJ signatures are smoking guns for models with a composite dark sector where a parton shower in the dark sector is followed by displaced decays of dark pions back to SM jets.
    
2.  **Summer REU in CU Pathways to Physics Program, 2021**  
    Interned at the University of Colorado Boulder "Pathways to CU Physics" program under mentorship of Prof. Keith Ulmer. Worked on developing a new "High Level Trigger" to identify events that may contain signature of decays of dark matter particles known as "Emerging Jets".

3.  **Research Semester abroad at CERN, Spring 2018**  
    Worked under the "University of Michigan-CERN Research Semester Program" on applying Machine Learning in HCAL DQM (Hadron Calorimeter Data Quality Monitoring). This work formed basis of my undergrad thesis under UPRM COOP program titled “Using Machine Learning Techniques for Data Quality Monitoring at CMS Experiment".
